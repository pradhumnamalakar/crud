In those 10 days I tested this device in every mean possible. So here is my detailed (and a short) review ----->>>>Build - This phone is really a champ when it come to its build quality. Its super thin, only 7.5mm. Its lightweight too. You may need to hold it carefully as it has slippery back (but not too much, only above average). Front looking is not so good but its really nice when it comes to its back looking.Feels premium in hands. I dropped this phone on first day itself and it proved its toughness.No damage was done to body or display when it was dropped from 5 ft to stone floor.Build - 10\/10Display - Display is very sharp and crisp. Also, the touch is so smooth that you will love it while using. It has Full HD Display and it really produces great colors. The 5.2 inch display makes it easier to use it in one hand easily. Also, there is a protection cover (some sort of tempered glass) on the display and it protects the display from dust and fingerprints. For added safety, you can also use another tempered glass. As for me, its not required.Display - 10\/10Performance - The octa core kirin 650 Processor makes sure that phone runs smoothly. I havent noticed any lag in this device while navigating through different apps. I also played some heavy games like Asphalt 8, Mortal Kombat X and I have never spotted any lag in FPS. This device can run all games very smoothly.There is no question on lag when using it normally. You can install as many apps as you like and this phone wont let you down.Performance - 10\/10Camera & Storage - it has really nice camera. Front 8mp camera performs well in daylight. In night. Its display brighten up automatically, working as front flash.It can capture decent selfies in dark too. As for 13 MP rear camera, its best I have ever seen. It really performs well in daylight. In night it performance is above average. As for storage, sorry but you need to use an external SD card as internal storage isnt sufficient. You get 8-9 GB of free space after updating to Nougat.Camera - 10\/10, Storage - 7\/10Battery & Software - The 3000 mAh battery is sufficient when it is used normally. It lasts about 1.5 days on normal use and with heavy use it may need to be recharged on the same day i.e. withing 24 hours. One negative point is that, its charging speed is too slow. It charges 1% in 2-3 minutes.Batter life depends on how you use this phone. As for software it comes with Android 6.0 with No VoLTE support. After updating it to Android 7.0 it gets VoLTE ability too. You can download themes from theme store and there are many options for customization.Battery - 9\/10, Software - 10\/10RAM and other features - After updating to Nougat it has 800-900 Mb of free RAM. There is enough RAM for a average user. Finger print sensor is good too. It unlocks device with some delay (0.5 seconds) but it is really accurate. Sound quality is good too. There are many sensors like Magnetometer, E Compass, etc.RAM - 8\/10.Overall this is really good product, its best mobile under 10,000 currently. (Ignore RAM, most of the people dont really need lots of RAM). If you are getting under 10,000, Just go for it. Its value for money. There is no regret, No disappointment. In short,Pros -Excellent displayNice sound qualityMetal bodyGood Battery BackupExcellent camera at this priceNice fingerprint sensorNougat update available as soon as you connect it to internetCons -Normal Heating issue when playing games (with Full Brightness) or using camera.Charging is slow (Normal)Low StorageNothing else. I hope I helped you.!!! Go for it if you have limited budget (apporx 8000 Rs.). Surely, its better than REDMI 4.Read mor","review6":"Instead of going to mi 3s or any other phone in this price range, better to buy this one because the original price was 20000 but due to huge price drop its available for just 7500.

Needs improvement.Call quality: Very goodSound: Speaker sound is decent. Earphone sound is greatBattery life: 1.5 days easily on heavy usages.

Feels like premium.Overall good phoneRead mor","review4":"This is the best phone you can get at this price.I couldnt find any problem so far, except for the lack of storage space. (Its only 16GB). It has a card slot but its hybrid, meaning that you can use two sim cards or a sim card and a micro sd card.Only one port supports 3G\/4G, the other port is 2GThe memory is 2GB. Its enough if youre not using it to play games.Read mor","review3":"What a phone! Sleek look, extremely light weight,good camera & functionality as smooth as butter! Performance is very good! Sometimes, nice phones like this get overshadowed in the useless hype of other brands. The phone has unremovable battery. You can use either of these: 1+1 sim or 1 sim+micro sd.Summary: This phone is beyond expectations & one wont regret buying this phone...& bonus: Its very cheap with quite good fetaures & you dont have to unnecessarily throw away money for buying phones with sub-par performances. Highly recommended!!Read mor","review2":"Pros:Build quality, superb camera, superb display, android N, very good network reception, Kirin 650 processer...lag free performance & great gameplay, fingerprint with gestures for camera, navigation.etcCons:No fast charging, no otg support (there r some tricks after rooting though), hybrid sim slot(not a problem for me)This is a great buy at this price point, u wont feel lags even with 2gb ram due its great processor.

The only game I plays in mobile phone is Wcc2 and the battery is draining bit fast.There is no turbo charging in this phone, it takes 2- 2.30 hours for full charge.Camera performance is satisfactory for me.. Takes some good photos except in low light and night. Front cam photo.. and quality for video calling is good. Some features like bokeh, wide aperture, portrait modes are good n fun.. and there is mode like pro photo and pro videos in which u may take better pics n vids(didnt try much)It comes with a hybrid sim slot.. So I opted for 64 gb variant. Hope it will be much enough for storage and I can use two sims at a time.After few days of purchasing, I got an update including face unlock feature..

Auto brightness too is sensitive n working fine.Battery backup: with moderate use lasts one day full. Not recommended for heavy gamers. The only game I plays in mobile phone is Wcc2 and the battery is draining bit fast.There is no turbo charging in this phone, it takes 2- 2.30 hours for full charge.Camera performance is satisfactory for me.. Takes some good photos except in low light and night. Front cam photo.. and quality for video calling is good. Some features like bokeh, wide aperture, portrait modes are good n fun.. and there is mode like pro photo and pro videos in which u may take better pics n vids(didnt try much)It comes with a hybrid sim slot.. So I opted for 64 gb variant. Hope it will be much enough for storage and I can use two sims at a time.After few days of purchasing, I got an update including face unlock feature.. Dont wanna use though.. Seems good..\"Heard Oreo update is coming soon..\"Verdict: Satisfied n happy with the phone.. And recommends this phone to my friends.. Rating 8 out of 10..Read mor"},"imgpath":"img\/amazon\/Honor 7X (Black, 4GB RAM + 64GB memory).jpg","price":16849,"Stars":"4.1","link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.in\/Honor-Black-4GB-64GB-memory\/dp\/B077PTJT5Z\/ref=sr_1_7?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1523463236&sr=1-7&keywords=honor","description":{"description6":"Item model numberBND-AL10","description7":" Wireless communication technologies Bluetooth, WiFi Hotspot","description4":"Product Dimensions15.7 x 0.8 x 7.5 cm","description5":"Batteries:1 Lithium Polymer batteries required.

I still wont regret even though the prices have fallen diwn to 12k. Been using this phone for almost 6 months now and it is one of the best phones out there.The build quality is great, it feels awesome to hold in hand. It has slipped many times from heights as far above as my shoulder, yet, no shatters or dents. The screen as well as fingerprint sensor is very responsive. The best thing in the phone is its camera. Kirin processor adds a cherry on the top by giving very good performance and optimizing battery usage despite of having a small one.Read mor","review6":"Amazing product- totally happy. Great camera.. one of the most affordable dual cameras when I bought.. Now youve more options in this price range. Detailed review on my blog. Limitations- either 2 SIM Cards or 1 SIM and 1 memory. Cant have 2 SIM card + memory card. The non removable battery and having to carry that pin is not very convenient. Otherwise overall very good phone.Read mor","review5":"I purchased this hand set a week ago.It is really superb.

First of all I bought it on a sale at a whopping price of 8k. Amazing deal I tell ye.The phone works just fine. I havent had any complaints after using this for some time now. The camera quality is great front and back. The space is 32GB so cant complaint. And the RAM support is great. And phone battery life is top notch. I can go on using the phone continuously. Like watching amazon prime videos like 5 videos in a row, listening to music, and use social media apps and still there is much percentage of battery left at the end of day. I dont know what more do you need from a smartphone these days.Read mor","review2":"I have been using this from around last 3 months, previously i was using motoG Turbo and it is a lot better phone in terms of everything except the build quality. screen get scratched easily and phone is bend from one side i dont even realized when.-CameraIt has a great camera in this price range and it offers a lot of shooting modes, Portrait mode is just fine, i dont use it much but sometimes it gives really good results. it even provides a pro mode but sadly no raw support, it can shoot 1080 video with good audio pick up, it can shoot slow motion video but it is bad. front camera and video quality is decent. overall the camera is really good for the price and moreover the camera software rocks !!- BatteryOne can expect a full day of battery life with heavy usage easily. if you are a normal use it can last you about1.5 to 2 days. Very Happy with the battery cause i never have to think about it for the whole day. it would have been great to see the fast charging though.-DisplayGreat Display with good color reproduction.-PerformanceI dont play games so i wont talk about gaming performance. Overall good performance in day to day usage. but now i feel there is a bit of lag sometimes after updating to emui 5.0, it happens rarely till now so, not much worried about it.If you are a person who wants good camera phone in this price range with decent battery life go for it. i chose it over redmi note 4 for camera.i wish it would have a better build quality, a bit loud n clear audio from speakers and raw support in camera. Hope this helps.ThanksRead mor","review1":"Brought this phone on March 2017,with a very quick delivery from Amazon. I would recon it as one of the best Value for Money mobiles in this price segment!Initially I was hesitant to buy a mobile from the Huaweis sub company Honor since it wasnt much known in India. But within a day of usage that thought was changed! Huaweis own Kirin chipset is a fabulous one maintaining power performance and energy at unbelievable rate. The battery lasts for a solid day for heavy usage(playing a movie, playing atleast 800MB sized game, etc)Spotlight goes to the dual camera setup which is the first known in this segment price range mobiles! Im not at all disappointed with its outdoor condition lighting and slips in artificial lights(it can be rectified in Pro Photo mode if u could fit the adjustments) The only lack in camera is the video stabilization...could have been better than given.Cons have to be absence of NFC and the second sim being only 2G support.

This is professional phone. So called 8 pro. Looks and clarity better than my friends Samsung note 4.the built is extremely soft and you dont feel weight. Battery is OK. You can save battery by optimising battery performance. Option available when you look up on the battery software. But you can expect a net of around 3800mah for sure .my suggestion if you have problem in spending money about 26k,please go for redmi note 4 costing 12000.the phones between these amounts are just craps. So either you go for redmi note 4 or honor pro 8.another alternative is coolpad 6,which has 6gb ram but 64gb rom but you cant expand it, cool pad 6comes in the range of 14,000.but there are some very negative reviews for coolpad 6.in the case of honor 8 pro if you are using Internet(heavy users) too much, you have to charge it minimum 2 times. But I am satisfied with this beast. Thank you honor for providing so cute and lovable phone.Read mor","review5":"Its a beautiful sleek phone though a bit heavy for one hand use..! Esp while clicking selfie. Besides that its a great phone though the colors r too pronounced and it beautify s selfie a bit too much!One thing to be noted by first time users of honor is that it has a 4g tab in the drop down menu which has to b activated to get 4g reception. Since we never realised it initially we had real bad network issues which we had attributed to a bad phone and our luck! Also put the sim in the correct slot.We felt it has a big drawback that is ... U cant use the hybrid slot to expand memory since this same slot is the one which is designated to be used for 4g sim. The other slot is only for a nano sim. But then u already have 128 gb.Overall I loved the phoneRead mor","review4":"Great Battery backup. Do Reset Phone after Software Update to get full battery performance.Camera is best.

Will write a review about features after some use. Battery lasts more than 36 hrs with light usage. EMUI is smooth and feels like pure android. More later.....Read mor","review6":"Been about a month a am using view 10 and my experience so far is beyond expectation.Camera quality is just awesome.Battery last 2 days once fully charged.Charging is very fast.Good audio and video quality.Read mor","review5":"Its been a month. And I am more than happy with this device. Yes it has its flaws but also has some features which helps it to be better smartphone. The best features are battery life, design, speed and camera. The not so good part would be despite being a wonderful camera it lacks EIS and OTIS which kind of scars the overall ability of camera features. All in all its a brilliant phone. Go for it and you wont be disappointed.Read mor","review4":"It has all the latest trendy best features with oreo8. Its been more than 2 months and not yet faced any issue. Camera is just awesome. It has a lot of modes. If you compare with oneplus5t than it has only few drawbacks such as video stability and night mode but it has good plus point that is tbe lower price.Read mor","review3":"Front camera is good, back camera need little bit more improvisation.AI - cant figure out much of difference.Overall perfect piece for prize bracket of below 30K.Read mor","review2":"First pros!1. Performance - AwesomeYou can very well compare it to any phone with Snapdragon 8352. Screen - Awesome18:9 aspect ratio full hd+ IPS LCD display with great viewing angles, color reproduction and brightness levels. You wont miss the amoled display from Samsung or oneplus.3. Memory - Awesome128 GB rom and 6 gb ram. Gives you 100gb usable storage. And 4gb free memory out of the box.4. Fingerprint scanner : awesomeFast, responsive, and placed where I like it. In the front.5. Camera - AwesomeDual camera, bokeh effect, low light, front camera, front bokeh, beautification, AR feature ... Everything best in class!6. Looks - Good EnoughBlue color looks great from front, a little boring from the back.7. Battery - Awesome20-30% always left after a long busy day. Lasts 30hrs for me.8. Extra - Face recognition, Ir blaster, headphone jackNow cons!1. Charging time: Too slowFor me, it takes 3-4 hrs to full charge. I leave it to charge all night2. A bit bulky: one handed usage is a bit difficultOneplus has smaller footprint with same screen size but v10 has fingerprint scanner in the front.3. Audio output: could have been betterSamsung, LG, oneplus all have great audio outputs. This one is a tad bit low on that front.4. No OIS or EIS : need steady hands for low light stills and videos are always shaky.5. Resale value : it will not get the resale value like iPhone or Samsung or even like oneplus. Monetary value for this one will fall greatly.I chose this over oneplus 5t because I wanted 128gb memory, front fingerprint scanner under 30k. With 3k extra oneplus 5t gives lower memory and for 128gb it costs 38k. Oneplus does not give anything special for 8k extra.
