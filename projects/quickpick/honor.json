Battery back up is huge, 6.5 to 7 hours of screen on time. Display quality is very nice. Easily visible in sinlight. This one also runs every application smoothly. Ram management is good. Only the front camera in lowlight produces reddish images. And honor should provide android oreo now. Also honor deVices doesnt support native video calling and one cant lock messenger by the default applock as only the app messenger is Not present in the applock list. Its an issue with the every honor devices. I dont know why they are not fixing these issues.","review6":"Camera is quite good and gives the SLR feelings with depth analyzer. Although the selfie cam requires improvement.Performance wise okay sort in this price rangeIn built apps are good and in house OS junk & memory handlers are a big plus which requires no third party app installation to maintain this phone and its quite goodPhones output volumes - both from loudspeaker and call speaker are bit less, with headphones it produces decent sound thoughOS updates are okay, it delivers what it promised but updates appear considerably later than other products in the marketBattery is ok sort, with the provide mAH, it should have performed betterBig turn off is hybrid second SIM slot, which considerably lessens opportunity as a smartphone user, I mean why companies even think of hybrid slots in this age!!!!All in all, a good candidate with decent camera features in sub 15K category.","review5":"Around 2 Months With This Phone ..The Phone Is Perfect For Everyone .I am A College Student The Phone Easily Works All The Day With Me the phone Has a Good Battery Backup .. Some Of The User Has Doubt About its speaker . I want To Say That Left One Is Mike & Right One Is a Speaker (Only one speaker In Phone) ... The Camera Quality Is Good As Compare To Mi A1 But The Portrait Mode Is Not Good As Mi A1 ... The Portrait is Not Crisp.. But Image Is Of Very Good Contrast & Bright Color .. Front Camera Is Good... I feel Sometimes The Touch Became Irresponsive . For Few Seconds.. I think Its an ROM problem ..The Fingureprint Sensor Is Very Fast As Compare To Other Branch.... The Antutu Benchmark Score Came Out To be 77500 Which Is Impressive.. At all The Phone Is Good With Nice Design..","review4":"Today i am going to give you guys a short review on honor 6x. Well, the packaging was great. The was in good condition.1. This phones main feature is the dual camera 12MP+2MP. The camera quality is good during daylight.But tge night or low light photo shoot is not that great. Maybe better than some other mid range phone but, not very good. I am kinda disappointed on the camera. Maybe i expected too much.2. The screen quality is good. Its 1920x1080 resolution which is great. The sunlight readability is also fine. Overall i am happy with the 2.5D screen. The videos look great.3. The sound quality is not good. The bass is worse. The high and lows are also medium. The speaker is not good for listening to music.4. The battery works fine. It gives a full day usage with normal use. I am pretty satisfied with its battery.5. The performance is not great in Android 6.0. But after upgrading to Android 7.0 the performance is superb. You can run any high def. games smoothly on this device. The memory management is also good in this phone.6. This phone doesnt include headphone with it. Although sound in headphone is far better than speaker.","review3":"Overall very good phone at this price point. I have used this phone for more than 6 months now.Positives : Excellent battery management, processor speed is very good and dont see a lag, upgrades for operating systems and installations have been very smooth so far, does not need to install any additional utility apps as the base system brings most necessary ones like cleaning tool, etcCould be better : camera in low light, dual sim but one slot gets into micro SD","review2":"I am totally satisfied with this phone. I bought this phone at Rs.9,999. I am going to list the pros and cons of this device.Pros.1. Best Camera in this price segment.2. Its speakers are not bad as described in the other reviews. The sound quality is not excellent but is up to the mark.3. Performance of this device is very good. I have not experienced any lags in 15 days of usage of this phone. There is always 1.7-1.8gb of RAM free in the 3gb variant.4. Multitasking is very good. Memory Management is excellent.5. Call Quality is excellent.6. Battery Backup is also very good. I charge this phone once in 1.5 days.Cons.The only con is that it has a hybrid sim slot. But you can use both sim cards and a memory card by buying a hybrid sim adapter.Overall this phone is worth buying as it is the best in its class.","review1":"Brought this phone on March 2017,with a very quick delivery from Amazon. I would recon it as one of the best Value for Money mobiles in this price segment!Initially I was hesitant to buy a mobile from the Huaweis sub company Honor since it wasnt much known in India. But within a day of usage that thought was changed! Huaweis own Kirin chipset is a fabulous one maintaining power performance and energy at unbelievable rate. The battery lasts for a solid day for heavy usage(playing a movie, playing atleast 800MB sized game, etc)Spotlight goes to the dual camera setup which is the first known in this segment price range mobiles! Im not at all disappointed with its outdoor condition lighting and slips in artificial lights(it can be rectified in Pro Photo mode if u could fit the adjustments) The only lack in camera is the video stabilization...could have been better than given.Cons have to be absence of NFC and the second sim being only 2G support. Other than that it is a stylish,killer mobile!(And Im also became a fan of EMUI now which I was not before)","review10":"Overall very good phone at this price point.

Yesterday morning i received this phone and did full charge and after heavy use of watching videos, playing games, downloading movies and upgrading to Oreo i am writing this review at 47% of battery life. Was always a Huawei fan and will always be. Will recommend this to my colleagues too. Forget Vivo, Oppo, MI, Motorola, Nokia and all under 30K just go for 8 Pro blindly","review2":"Awesome phone I really love it after update it becomes perfect for me thanks Amazon.now I really loves honor 8 pro.

What an amazing phone in this price is a complete steal. Our bad all the high end specifications to be a true flagship killer. Awesome display great camera top notch battery what not. It also did not miss on small things like infrared nfc USB type c and also headphone jack in such a thin body 6.9 mm. I received software update a soon as I inserted my sim. Now people talk about heating issue. I found its there but not that pronounce. Update has reduced this problem a lot only you will feel it during prolong camera use. Anyways no one is going to use this phone naked is such elegant that it commands protection. Wind a back cover you wont feel a thing.

Got it for 3999rs and its worth the penny. The phone is slim to my surprise and is lighter even after putting the battery. Screen is the most attractive part. Viewing angles are good and Colors are vivid. Camera is OK for some occasional shots. Beauty mode works well for the front camera. With good lighting one can get some decent shot on both the cameras. I bought it for my dad and he generally uses it for calls no internet at all and gets about 2 days battery life. With data on it may last for one day. If 4k is ur budget then this is ur phone.

Camera not good enough.. Tried to return but amazon denied..","review6":"previous version of Honor phone they gave two speakers but in Honor 7X only one speaker at the bottom,speaker sound is very low. when you are in traffic or our side your home you cant hear the voice properly, Navigation menu buttons are very small you have to carefully press on the the buttons to navigate.screen aspect ration is good and finger print sensor is fast.","review5":"The Honor 7x is a phone purely designed for Indian Customers.This phone has performance which is comparable to the snapdragon 625.The only downside I find in this phone is the speaker which is totally garbage.The EMUI interface is not so good but I could get stock experience by using the Nova Launcher App which is recommended if u dont want to use a fake iOS based UI.I GIVE THIS Phone 4 stars although I understand that budget is an issue.I would not mind paying a bit more cash for a better speaker.And finally the addition of a Headphone Jack is much appreciated.","review4":"The phone is good, battery is also goodBut m not happy with the storage I bought the 32gb one but when I bought the phone it had only 14gb left i know all about the framework and all but m not happy with the storage","review3":"I didnt believed that this phone was fast, it just blew my mind, loads of tonnes of feature amazing, Ram management is excellent and fingerprint sensor is super quick. You can play games like mobile legends at high graphics. Doesnt heats up while playing thats the thing i like. you should really go for this phone. Just loved it","review2":"Amazing experience, using it for over 5-6 weeks.Bought it for only 10,999 .

Really its too good... Huawei has done excellent job.. It has face unlock(update), the battery runs for an entire day, the phone is just fully optimised, volte support for jio, vadfone and airtel, the phone is awesome for office work to college workCons :I didnt liked the camera and the speaker.. Speaker in the sense is shrill...
