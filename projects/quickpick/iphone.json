Small but powerful. Only drawbacks - single sim and 1.2 front MP camera. Rest everything top notch. Every thing can be done using one hand.26000 was a bit too much already. Thanks to Amazon who reduced the price to 18000 which one can say is the best price for the phone.","review9":"I got this phone for 20k.In this price range the processing power,usability and camera performance are top notch.Iev being using this mobile for a month the battery life is consistently good i.e 16hr of mixed usage..The best part about having this phone is the feeling of not having it as its very light in the pocket...Feels good in the hand too....","review8":"Good in condition, delivered within time.About iphone SE: it is very comfortable for handling due to small size, remaining all other features are as equal to 6S.

Have only charged the phone for 20 mins in the past 2 days, and the battery is going strong, which is a huge change from the earlier phone!","review6":"This one from oneplus is just amazing, the build quality is top notch, just holding it feels premium and the overall UI experience is fluid and coming to the camera though he had provided with same sensors having same focal length it manages to take good portrait images even in low light than that of oneplus 5. Coming to accessories the addition of a silicon case with the smartphone is good Add-on from oneplus. So to include with the review I would say you wont regret once buying it and using it, so its a big yes from me for people who are looking for perfect budget smartphone which is capable to compete with the high end ones easily.","review5":"Delivery prompt. 5 stars for sticking to delivery schedule. Mobile excellent. Would have given 5stars but the biggest drawback is that there is no provision to silence the volume. Minimum volume is 17 %. Big disadvantage. Otherwise the mobile is a must have.Editing this review as I figured out how to use DND.had to same issue, and figured it out. Its a physical feature on the phone, not a software one. Just above the volume control (left side of phone), there is a slider switch that moves in 3 positions. Top position = Silent mode Middle = DND Bottom = Normal mode.","review4":"Looks good. Amazing speakers. No lags. Fast and good performance. Battery with Battery save mode lasts for really long. Though, I cant deny that the camera isnt as good as I expected. Not as great as Samsung S8 camera(Mainly when talking about the sharpness and clarity). But yes, good enough considering the differences in their price range. And the portrait mode is impressive. And low light pics are good too. Even the display isnt as good as S8. but for its price, the best. Worth the money!","review3":"Excellent phone. Im very happy with it. Best bang for your bucks. The in-hand feel is spectacular. Devices felt very well balanced & the weight distribution is almost spot on - this is something which Apple has executed well in the past. Glad to see OnePlus paying attention to these details. The screen is bright, clear & unless you pixel-peep with a magnifying glass, you wont notice any pixelation. Battery life is also acceptable, lasts for a day & topping it up with the dash-charger is easy-peasy.Photo quality is mostly great under normal conditions and unacceptable in darker situations. But thats okay with me. I didnt pay a small fortune like I would have for getting an ivy-league iphone or a Pixel. Overall, great phone & I dont see myself upgrading or changing anytime soon. This phone offers all the phone I would need for the time being.","review2":"The best phone of 2017 by far. Its fast, intuitive and a great value for the price. There are phones with similar specs like Samsung Galaxy 8 and 9 and the Google pixel but they come at almost double the price. And OnePlus offers the same for a great value. The only con I feel is the selfie camera which at times fails to detect details especially in low light. But that is only nitpicking, the portrait mode for the rear camera is a treat.The battery easily lasts 1.5 days with normal everyday use and charging takes no time with the dash charger. Reviews suggest battery life is the best for OnePlus 5T amongst all Android and Apple flagships that came recently. Dont think twice go ahead and buy it. OnePlus has become a strong global brand in a short time and it seems that they have been able to sustain through the competition.","review1":"This device is insanely fast. Im amazed by its performance.Here are some highlights of the device from me.- It is insanely fast. Couldnt resist myself from mentioning this again.- It loads everything very quickly. Thanks to 6GB of RAM.- Even after a heavy usage, it does not heat up. It gets little warmer but not much.- Battery life is super. This is very interesting bcz it has 3300 MAh battery and 18:9 display but it is still lasting for a complete day even with the heavy usage.- The dash charger. It is the fastest. Charges phone upto 60% in 30 mins and 100% in just 1hr.- The camera quality is decent. The front camera is nice. The rear camera quality could have been better.- It has beautiful 2:1 ratio AMOLED screen.- Oxygen OS is somewhat like stock android. And you can also customize your phone a lot.- Face unlocking. What can I say about this feature. It is blazing fast. Unlocks my phone within a blink of an eye and works well even in low light.- The fingerprint sensor is also very fast, same as the face unlock feature I would say.- You get a tpu case.But here are some things I dont like about this device.- the back is very slippery. But they have provided a back case.- It has a mono speaker. Dont get me wrong, the output of the speaker is good but when you set the volume to full the sound feels like noisy.Other than this, Oneplus 5t is a great smartphone in this price segment considering its features.Hit the thumbs up if you find this helpful.","review10":"The best phone of 2017 by far.

Currently i am using both iphone as my primary phone and Redmi Note 4 as my secondary phone for gaming multimedia etc...overall i am quite happy with my decision of buying iphone SE the smallest yet powerful iphone...Talking about battery which is foremost requirement it does surprised me as i tried to draine it by using it for calls whatsapp browsing watching youtube videos and finally watching Kryptons eposide 4 which is of 45 mins video yet it managed to stay at 13% till midnight. So its really a beast.Camera is fantastic, SloMo is awesome, i dont really play games in it as its really small so cant comment on it, my redmi Note 4 is a good gaming device ;)Heating issue is thr little bit because i dont use back cover but not that grave..it happens only when u use it for a long time like when i used it for watchig one episode.Network receptor is good, call quality is goof enough too, browsing is fluidic....Being an android lover i dint find a single con.... plz tell me if u can.","review6":"Very very bad packaging from Amazon.

I was using Nexus 6P Special Edition, however, wanted to venture into the Apple world and this model seemed to be a good reason to not spend too much but get the taste of the ios.This phone packs great features, read through reviews and watch YouTube videos before you make your decision.

Mobile is working still fine. No heating and unexpected shutdown issue. iPhone is updated to latest iOS 11.2.5. Camera quality is far better than my old Sony Xperia Z5 Dual. As a photographer, if you are mobile photographer so must try with iPhone 6s. In older flagship models of apple only 6s Plus has OIS. But dont worry. Without it you can shoot very clear and focused images.","review10":"This is really a good phone I think one of the last good phone launched by apple.. better than iPhone 7 and 8..
