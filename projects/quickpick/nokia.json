This review is not about the specs. It is about how the phone and its features actually work!Pros:- GPS locks pretty fast even without 3g or an active wifi connection. Seems to work well even inside a public bus.- e-compass works well.- fingerprint sensor works well.- Phone comes with encryption turned on- Hall sensor works. BTW, the sensor is somewhere near the middle of the screen. Close to the place where the day of the week is shown on the lock screen!- Tapping on the fingerprint sensor wakes up the phone and unlocks the screen too!- Tried playing a few videos, they played without any stutter- I was able to play \"Real Racing 3\" without any issues. I did not try other games.- Speaker is reasonably loud (not sure about clarity)- The back and right most buttons have backlight. The fingerprint sensor does not have a backlight though.- Battery life seems to be good. I typically turn on 4g\/wifi only when needed. Seems to last for about 3 days.Cons- Could not find a flip cover that works with the hall sensor... yet. But, this is not a big deal, Tapping on the fingerprint sensor wakes up the screen and unlocks it. But, you cant look at the time by just flipping open the cover though.- There is a minor light bleed on the left edge of the screen. It is only seen when the screen is completely black. Not a big deal though. Atleast one another person has reported the same issue on xda-developers.- Very minor blueish bleed at the bottom left corner of the screen. Not sure if this is just a manufacturing defect on my phone. This is very difficult to even notice.","review3":"Except for low light camera quality.. the Phone is promising.. elegant in design and built quality..","review2":"I have been using this phone almost last 5 months pretty satisfied with the phone. It has a decent performance and have a great experience with its camera. Also the phone looks amazing with its charming design. I would recommend this phone if you are looking for a decent phone in this.
