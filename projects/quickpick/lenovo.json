I didnt consider it a budget phone as it cost me Rs. 8800. It performs below my expectation which is really set very low as I use phone minimally like for making calls, internet surfing for at max 3-4hrs, document readings etc. At times, the touchpad doesnt respond at specific positions. Network availability fluctuates (Im not quite sure whether the phone is to blame, but my previous phone had zero issues in the same area Im staying). Loudspeaker and youtube (w\/o plug-in) sound are very low. My phone doesnt have the heating up issue as others have mentioned. I bought Lenovo as finding service centers could be easy for issue resolutions. Now I find that only this aspect of my decision while buying the phone was correct. I would recommend Redmi Xiaomi phones. Theyre the best as Ive seen from my personal experience.","review2":"The phone was delivered in excellent condition, and it was properly sealed and packed.

Security master app works better in all these respects, so stop and switch off mobile to get fast charging. It will never heat, while running mx player charging is not affected be sure.3) charging cable is bit hard buy another one and keep the original safe, original damages otg slot soon.4) delete or disable apps that you dont use often, this will fetch you free RAM space.But dont forget to keep backup using a memory card or pendrive. Do keep the backup of new handset on pendrive or memory card as while attempting to factory reset datas on inbuilt memory is lost.5) Do remember to install play services first while trying to restore apps after formatt or software updates.THESE BASICS IF TAKEN CARE, Am sure its the best handset that has dslr features too.","review10":"This product has a very poor performance interms of storage, OS, display and connectivity. I had a very bad experience with the product and the delivery by the third party logistics partner of Amazon India. This device stopped working in the 2nd week of its operation and Amazon being the seller has not provided any support against this. Very sorry to say that investing certain amount of time, energy and money into such trust-able brands (LENOVO & AMAZON) has made a fool out of its loyal customers. Now I think more than 10 times to order any dam thing from it & suggest the same for its prospected customers.","review9":"I have this mobile since a year and its best provided we know to maintain RAM.Many ppl wrote its heating, and charging cable too not good.Out of my personal experience I had seen 2 out of 10 handsets are not good, its just a game of luck.2 out of 10 handsets doesnt have good n sharp, camera or sometime focus problems.Check on day 1 or return.2) handset heating issue is not a big issue, better stop apps that are consuming power at background. Security master app works better in all these respects, so stop and switch off mobile to get fast charging. It will never heat, while running mx player charging is not affected be sure.3) charging cable is bit hard buy another one and keep the original safe, original damages otg slot soon.4) delete or disable apps that you dont use often, this will fetch you free RAM space.But dont forget to keep backup using a memory card or pendrive. Do keep the backup of new handset on pendrive or memory card as while attempting to factory reset datas on inbuilt memory is lost.5) Do remember to install play services first while trying to restore apps after formatt or software updates.THESE BASICS IF TAKEN CARE, Am sure its the best handset that has dslr features too.","review8":"Mic has some issues as the person cant get your voice properly.."},"imgpath":"img\/amazon\/amaz_lenovo\/Lenovo K6 Note (Silver).jpg","price":9998,"Stars":"2.9","link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.in\/Lenovo-K6-Note-Silver\/dp\/B01N7IZM1H\/ref=sr_1_15?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1523725853&sr=1-15&keywords=lenovo","description":{"description6":"Item model numberK6 Note","description7":" Wireless communication technologies Bluetooth, WiFi Hotspot","description4":"Product Dimensions15.1 x 0.8 x 7.6 cm","description5":"Batteries:1 A batteries required.

Actually I waited for NOKIA 6, but Hybrid SIM slot makes me disappoint. I just share my view and level of satisfaction here.Performance and multitasking is awesome.(with the split screen).HD display is good with 1080p movie(:O).Back Camera is awesome. and front camera is good.High End gamings are working charm.Dolby sound is not that much effective.Ive a doubt, Is that really a dash charger??? (It taking 1 & 1\/2 hrs to get complete 100% from 10%) :(Little bit tough with single hand usage (especially while selfie).Over all ....
